      "description": "DevOps engineers, developers, and security engineers have ever-changing roles to play in today's cloud native world. In order to build secure and resilient applications, you have to be equipped with security knowledge. Enter security as code.\n\nIn this book, authors BK Sarthak Das and Virginia Chu demonstrate how to use this methodology to secure any application and infrastructure you want to deploy. With Security as Code, you'll learn how to create a secure containerized application with Kubernetes using CI/CD tooling from AWS and open source providers.\n\nThis practical book also provides common patterns and methods to securely develop infrastructure for resilient and highly available backups that you can restore with just minimal manual intervention.\n\n- Learn the tools of the trade, using Kubernetes and the AWS Code Suite.\n- Set up infrastructure as code and run scans to detect misconfigured resources in your code.\n- Create secure logging patterns with CloudWatch and other tools.\n- Restrict system access to authorized users with role-based access control (RBAC).\n- Inject faults to test the resiliency of your application with AWS Fault Injector or open source tooling.\n- Learn how to pull everything together into one deployment.",

      "description": "The fourth book in the 'European Public Investment Outlook' series focuses on the urgent issue of how to finance needed investment in critical tangible and intangible infrastructure given high levels of public debt, a thorny problem facing many governments across Europe. Drawing on expertise from academics, researchers at public policy institutes and international governance bodies, the contributors analyse the current situation and prospects and propose feasible solutions.\nFinancing Investment in Times of High Public Debt offers a powerful combination of high-level analysis of cross-continental policies and trends, with close examination of specific contexts in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. The chapters in Part II explore challenges including how to finance climate investments, the extent to which national promotional banks can offer solutions, EU budget reform and recent trends in tax progressivity.\nThis book is essential reading for economists, policymakers, and anyone interested in implementing and financing public policy in Europe and wanting to better understand the intricacies of EU governance and institutions.",
